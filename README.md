# ðŸ›  Webact ðŸŒŽ

Webact is a tiny library that helps you create web components in a manner
similar to Vue and React. Without the need for heavy tools like Babel and
Webpack that cripples your iterative workflow. âš™

## Examples

### With render method | Like with React class based component

The following will take the result from the render method and put it in
ShadomDOM and create a `<my-app>` component.

```
import { Component, registerComponent } from 'https://unpkg.com/webact';

class MyApp extends Component {
  static get observedAttributes() {
    return ['to-whom'];
  }

  render({ toWhom }) {
    return `<b>Hello ${toWhom}</b>`;
  }
}

registerComponent(MyApp);

document.querySelector('#app').innerHTML = `
  <div>
    <my-app to-whom="world"></my-app>
  </div>
`;
```

### With HTML and CSS | Like Vue sigle file components

Having HTML, CSS and JS in separate files is kind to both you and all the tools
you use! Vue-style, and also the style my team used with Backbone back in the
days at TIDAL (read 2015).

The following will load the HTML file into the components ShadowDOM with the CSS
and create a `<my-app>` component.

```
/components
   /my-app
      /my-app.js
      /my-app.css
      /my-app.html
```

```js
import { Component, registerComponent } from "https://unpkg.com/webact";

class MyApp extends Component {
  constructor() {
    super(import.meta.url);
  }

  static get observedAttributes() {
    return ["to-whom"];
  }
}

registerComponent(MyApp);

document.querySelector("#app").innerHTML = `
  <div>
    <my-app to-whom="world"></my-app>
  </div>
`;
```

### With methods | Like React function components

You can create components via functions as well. This is done via the
`registerFunctionComponent` helper method exposed. If `observedAttributes` is
specified the component will re-render when one of those attributes changes.

```js
registerFunctionComponent(callback: Function, { metaUrl: ?string, observedAttributes: ?string[] })
```

#### Hooks

Some "hooks" like methods are exposed.

```ts
postRender(callback: Function)

/*
Takes a function as input. This function is called on `connectedCallback` in the custom element lifecycle and on `attributeChangedCallback`. Equivalent to the `useEffect` hook and componentDidMount lifecycle callback in React.
*/
```

```ts
propsChange(callback: Function)

/*
Takes a function as input. This function is called on `attributeChangedCallback` in the custom element lifecycle. First parameter is an object with all the attributes of the custom elements. Not that the entire ShadowDOM is trashed on `attributeChangedCallback`, so do not attempt any DOM manipulation here. This is only for reacting to attribute changes for other purposes.
*/
```

```ts
html(markup: TemplateStringsArray)
/*
Tagged template litteral. Call this with your markup and it will be injected into the shadow DOM of your component.
*/
```

```ts
useHTML(path: ?string)
/*
If there is a path specified, it will be fetched and used for the markup in the shadow DOM. If no path is specified and the second argument to registerFunctionComponent is the path to the JS file provided you follow the recommended component structure, a file with the same name as the js file in the same folder will be fetches but with the .html extention for use as markup in the shadow DOM.
*/
```

```ts
css(styles: TemplateStringsArray)
/*
Tagged template litteral. Call this with your styles and it will be injected as a Constructable Stylesheet into the shadow DOM of you component.
*/
```

```ts
useCSS(path: ?string)
/*
If there is a path specified, it will be fetched and used for the Constructable Stylsheet for the shadow DOM. If no path is specified and the second argument to registerFunctionComponent is the path to the JS file provided you follow the recommended component structure, a file with the same name as the js file in the same folder will be fetches but with the .css extention for use as styles in the shadow DOM.
*/
```

```ts
$(query: ?string): HTMLElement |Â ShadowRoot
/*
jQuery like helper method to querying stuff in the shadow dom. An empty string or no parameter can be passed in and the method will return the custom element instance. ':host' will select the shadow DOM root, just like the CSS rule.
*/
```

```ts
$$(query: string): NodeList
/*
jQuery like helper method to querying stuff in the shadow dom. An empty string or no parameter can be passed in and the method will return the custom element instance. ':host' will select the shadow DOM root, just like the CSS rule.
*/
```

#### Example

```js
import { registerFunctionComponent } from "https://unpkg.com/webact";

function FancyButton() {
  const { html, css, postRender, $ } = this;

  html`
    <button type="button">
      <slot></slot>
    </button>
  `;

  css`
    button {
      background-color: pink;
      color: gold;
      padding: 0.5em 1em;
      border-radius: 4px;
    }
  `;

  postRender(() => {
    const button = $("button");

    button.addEventListener("click", () => {}, false);
  });
}

export default registerFunctionComponent(FancyButton);
```

### Interop with React and similar

`export default` the result of the `registerComponent` method. This method
returns the name of the custom element for this component. In the example below
that would be `my-app`.

my-app.js:

```js
import { Component, registerComponent } from "https://unpkg.com/webact";

class MyApp extends Component {
  static get observedAttributes() {
    return ["to-whom"];
  }

  render({ toWhom }) {
    return `<b>Hello ${toWhom}</b>`;
  }
}

export default registerComponent(MyApp);
```

then in a React component import and use it like any other React component;

```js
import * as React from "react";

import MyRealApp from "./my-app.js";

export default function MyReactApp() {
  return (
    <div class="ugly-jsx">
      <MyRealApp to-whom="Jeremy" />
    </div>
  );
}
```

This process should be the same for all virtual DOMs and JSX implementations.

## Usage

Webact is currently running live in production at these sites.

### TIDAL - Google Cast Receiver

The Google Cast Receiver for [TIDAL](https://tidal.com) - the UI you see on your
TV while casting - is built using this library,

### Podd-App

URL: https://podd.app

A progressive web app where you can listen to podcasts. The site server side
render web components (made with Webact) with help from
[Wext.js](https://github.com/Vufuzi/wext.js) (bascially just an express with
support for sending partials of new pages upon navigation).

### Plypp Piano Beta

URL: https://plypp-beta.netlify.com

A piano applicaton with uses sound fonts. A sound font is pretty huge so time to
interactive is a bit long, sorry about that. Web components here use the
functional component pattern of Webact with css and html template string hooks.
